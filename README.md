# php type juggeling
Research in to php type juggeling.

Here are 4 versions of php type juggeling.

The md5 and sha1 version will find hashes that start with 0e and ends after that only with numbers.

The hmac version would do the same but than it support's md5 and sha1 but using a hmac.

And multiple others with/without json_decode.

This could be used as POC for php type juggeling vulnerabilities.
