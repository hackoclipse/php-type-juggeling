# php-type-juggeling
research in to php type juggeling.

here are 3 versions of php type juggeling.
the md5 and sha1 version will generate hashes that start with 0e and ends after that only with numbers.
the hmac version would work with md5 and sha1 but using hash_hmac.

this could be used a POC for php type juggeling vulnerabilities.
